# Bash Missions 7 to 10

This repository continues from where Missions 4 to 6 left off, diving deeper into core Bash scripting concepts. These scripts demonstrate practical use of arrays, functions, and basic file operations. Everything is hands-on and tested line by line.


## Mission 7: Arrays

- `fruit_list.sh`  
  Collects a list of fruits from the user, stores them in an array, and displays the final list.

- `favorite_colors.sh`  
  Works the same way as the fruit list, but focuses on collecting favorite colors using an array.

## Mission 8: Advanced Arrays

- `grocery_list.sh`  
  Starts with a static grocery list, then lets the user update it interactively. Updated list is printed at the end.

- `todo_tracker.sh`  
  A simple task manager. User enters a list of tasks, completes some, and the script shows what's left. Includes reverse order and array filtering.

## Mission 9: Functions

- `math_functions.sh`  
  Prompts the user to input two numbers and select an operation (add, subtract, multiply). Uses Bash functions to perform calculations.

- `user_utils.sh`  
  Simulates a user creation system. Checks if a username exists and handles simple logic for mock creation.

- `calculator.sh`  
  A more structured calculator script using functions and a case statement. Handles all basic operations, including division with error-checking.

## Mission 10: File Operations

- `file_sorter.sh`  
  Sorts the lines of a given file alphabetically. Simple script to help clean up and organize data files.

- `file_searcher.sh`  
  Searches for a keyword in a file and prints matching lines. Basic introduction to text search automation.

- `file_cleaner.sh`  
  Cleans up a text file by removing blank lines and lines that begin with a comment (`#`). Useful for tidying config or notes files.
  
## How to Run

To run a script, use `bash script_name.sh`  
Or make it executable first with `chmod +x script_name.sh` and run it using `./script_name.sh`.

**Purpose**  
These missions were built to strengthen core scripting skills with a focus on writing simple, readable, and functional Bash scripts. All scripts are committed to GitHub for tracking progress and practice.
